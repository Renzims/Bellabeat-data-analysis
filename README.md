## 3. Process
### 🧠 Objective  
Prepare the FitBit Fitness Tracker dataset for analysis by cleaning, transforming, and validating the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.  
This stage ensures that all data is structured and ready for analysis in Python and Tableau.
### 🧰 Tools Used  
* **Python** - Data transformation and cleaning
* **Tableau** - Final analysis and visualization
### 🧹 Data Process Steps  
#### 1. Import and Combine Datasets
- Load all individual CSV files (Daily Activity, Daily Sleep, Hourly Sleep, Hourly Steps, Hourly Calories, Hourly Intensity) into Pandas DataFrames.  
- Verify the structure and data types of each dataset using `df.info()` and `df.head()`.  
- Standardize column names for consistency (e.g., `ActivityDate`, `SleepDay`, `Id`).
#### 2. Data Cleaning
- Convert date and time columns (`ActivityDate`, `ActivityHour`, `SleepDay`) to `datetime` format using `pd.to_datetime()`.  
- Remove duplicate entries using `df.drop_duplicates()`.  
- Ensure all numeric fields (e.g., `TotalSteps`, `Calories`, `TotalDistance`) are stored as numeric types (`float` or `int`).
#### 3. Data Merging and Alignment
- Merge datasets on common keys (e.g., `Id`, `ActivityDate`) to create a unified view of user activity and behavior.  
- Ensure matching date formats across datasets to avoid merge conflicts (`datetime64[ns]` vs `object`).  
- Use `pd.merge(..., how='left')` to preserve all main records while appending related data.
#### 4. Feature Engineering
- Create new variables to enrich the analysis, such as:
  - **ActivityRatio** = Active minutes / Total minutes  
  - **IntensityScore** = Weighted score of activity levels  
  - **Activity_time and TotalActiveTime** = Sum of all active minutes  
- Add derived features like **day of the week**, **week number**, or **time period** (morning, afternoon, evening).
#### 5. Outlier Detection
- Detect extreme values using **Isolation Forest**:
	- 🦶 **TotalSteps:** Unrealistic high values (>30k) removed → mean dropped *7493 → 6969*, std decreased (5166 → 4302).  
	- 🚶‍♂️ **TotalDistance:** Extreme distances (>25 km) eliminated → mean *5.37 → 4.91*, max *28 → 16.3*.  
	- 🏃‍♂️ **VeryActiveDistance / ModeratelyActiveDistance:** Long-tail distributions trimmed; std reduced by nearly 50%.  
	- ⏱️ **VeryActiveMinutes / FairlyActiveMinutes:** Outliers (600 min/day) removed → max reduced to ~137 and ~100 minutes.  
	- 🔥 **Calories:** Extreme calorie values (>4500 kcal) removed → mean *2327 → 2245*, std *688 → 590*.  
#### 6. User's patterns
* Creating a dataset to describe user behavior patterns:

| **Feature**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **avg_intensity_score**      | The average **IntensityScore** across all days — reflects overall user activity level.                                                   |
| **activity_stability**       | Calculated as *(1 - Coefficient of Variation)* of `IntensityScore`; indicates how consistent the user's activity is over time.           |
| **trend_score**              | The slope of linear regression through `IntensityScore` values — positive slope means increasing activity trend, negative means decline. |
| **weekend_activity_ratio**   | Ratio of average weekend intensity to weekday intensity. Values >1 imply higher weekend activity, <1 — higher weekday activity.          |
| **most_active_day**          | The day of the week when the user's **average IntensityScore** is highest (e.g., "Saturday" or "Wednesday").                             |
| **high_activity_ratio**      | Share of days classified as “High” intensity — measures how often the user engages in high activity levels.                              |
| **dominant_intensity_level** | The most frequent activity level category (`Low`, `Medium`, or `High`) across all recorded days.                                         |
## 4. Analyze
### Base Observations
- Most users show a **dominance of the LightActiveDistance (green segment)** — meaning their activity mainly consists of **light daily movement** rather than structured workouts.  
  ➡️ Typical pattern for fitness tracker users: more walking than running.
- The majority have **low-to-moderate activity levels**, composed primarily of light movement; only a small subset shows consistent medium or high-intensity activity.
- About **50% of users spend ≥90% of their time in light activity**, while only a few (≈6 users) show less than 80% light activity.  
  Medium activity often compensates for reduced high-intensity activity.
- Distance analysis shows that **short high-intensity sessions contribute disproportionately to total distance** — short bursts, but high efficiency.
- Most users are **moderately active** — many light minutes and kilometers.  
  Around **15% perform structured workouts** with higher intensity.  
  The **efficiency ratio (distance/time)** varies widely — some move a lot but slowly, others less but more effectively.
### Additional Behavioral Metrics

| **Metric**                      | **Meaning & Interpretation**                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Activity Stability (1 - CV)** | Measures how consistent the user’s daily activity is. Values closer to **1** mean more stable behavior.                                  |
| **Trend Score (Slope)**         | Linear regression trend of `IntensityScore` over time: <br> `>0` → growing activity, `≈0` → stable, `<0` → decreasing activity.          |
| **Weekend Ratio**               | Ratio of weekend to weekday intensity: <br> `>1` → more active on weekends (typical for office workers), `<1` → more active on weekdays. |
#### Insights
- Most users demonstrate **moderate stability** between `0.2–0.8`; around **7 users are highly unstable**, showing impulsive behavior.  
- Stability analysis shows most users fluctuate between **−0.5 and 0.3**, indicating some weekly rhythm but occasional breaks.
- **Activity trend:**  
  - 40% stable,  
  - 26% increasing,  
  - 34% decreasing.
- **Weekly rhythm:**  
  Most users are more active during weekdays; however, **9 users prefer weekends** for physical activity.  
  Activity spikes are especially strong on **Tuesday** and **Saturday**.
- **High-intensity days:**  
  10 users have **no active days**, while **9 users** spend over **60%** of days in high-intensity activity.
- Overall, category distribution is relatively balanced.
### Hourly Activity
- Hourly analysis shows a clear **increase in activity from 12:00 to 18:00**, with similar levels in the morning and evening, and a drop at night.
- Weekends show a **shift in peak activity** — instead of a strong 18:00 peak (typical on weekdays), **Saturday maintains higher activity throughout the day**.
- This suggests that weekday routines are time-constrained, while weekends have **distributed, flexible activity patterns**.
### Sleep Analysis
- **Longest sleep durations** are observed on **weekends and Wednesdays**.  
  Likely explanation: after short sleep on Monday–Tuesday (high activity days), users compensate midweek and on weekends.
- The **difference between total time in bed and minutes asleep** increases on weekends and Fridays — likely due to relaxation and recovery.
- **Correlation with activity:**
  - Higher activity → shorter but more regular sleep (better rhythm).  
  - Low activity → irregular sleep (over- or undersleeping).  
  - Medium activity → most balanced sleep pattern.
- **Friday** is the universal **"sleep crisis day"** — shortest sleep across all activity levels, probably due to later bedtime.
- **Weekend sleep extension** confirms compensation for “sleep debt” accumulated during the workweek.
- The **smallest gap between bed time and sleep time** is seen in the **medium activity group** — high and low groups show longer bed times, possibly due to fatigue or overtraining.
